# AI-emotion-detector
Online Social Media (OSM) like Facebook and Twitter has emerged as a powerful tool
to express via text people’s opinions and feelings about the current surrounding events. Understanding the emotions at the fine-grained level of these expressed thoughts is important for system
improvement. Such crucial insights cannot be completely obtained by doing AI-based big data
sentiment analysis; hence, text-based emotion detection using AI in social media big data has become
an upcoming area of Natural Language Processing research. It can be used in various fields such
as understanding expressed emotions, human–computer interaction, data mining, online education, recommendation systems, and psychology. Even though the research work is ongoing in this
domain, it still lacks a formal study that can give a qualitative (techniques used) and quantitative
(contributions) literature overview. This study has considered 827 Scopus and 83 Web of Science
research papers from the years 2005–2020 for the analysis. The qualitative review represents different
emotion models, datasets, algorithms, and application domains of text-based emotion detection.
The quantitative bibliometric review of contributions presents research details such as publications,
volume, co-authorship networks, citation analysis, and demographic research distribution. In the
end, challenges and probable solutions are showcased, which can provide future research directions
in this area.
